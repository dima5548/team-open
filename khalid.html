<p>Khalid Albaih initially wanted to lock away his art from those who didn&#8217;t credit him. &#8220;As an artist, I want my work out there, but I want my name out there as well,&#8221; explains Khalid. When Bilal Randeree, a CC Qatar affiliate member, introduced Khalid to CC licenses in 2010, he had a solution to both problems. With the requirement of attribution on all of the Creative Commons licenses, it was the easiest way for Khalid to share his art freely, reach a mass audience, and retain his name on his art.</p>

<p>Khalid is a Sudanese political cartoonist based in Qatar. He self-publishes <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KhalidAlbaih"><em>Khartoon!</em></a>&#160;&#8212; its name a twist on the capital city of his home country, Sudan. His cartoons are a frank social and political commentary on life in Sudan, the Arab world, and the whole globe.</p>

<p>As a political cartoonist based online, sharing is essential for Khalid. As a region undergoing massive social change, sharing is essential for the Arab world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Breaking down the misunderstanding and bridging the gap between east and west and creating a dialogue is my main focus with creating my art. I try to push boundaries with my art and try to reach new people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Khalid&#8217;s ultimate goal is for his messages to be heard. And after releasing his works under CC, his messages <em>were heard</em>. Khalid&#8217;s work spread around the world&#160;&#8212; instantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m very surprised that it happened so quickly. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of it. Other artists see how successful it is right now, and how far it has spread. I don&#8217;t think I need to say much more [about CC licenses]. It shows for itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just a few years after starting to use CC licenses, Khalid&#8217;s work has been shared by journalists, organizations, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/khalidalbaih/5411335016/">even graffiti&#8217;d in Tahrir Square</a> during the Arab Spring revolution. He has been featured worldwide in publications like <em>The Economist, New York Times, Al Jazeera, BBC,</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em>, as well as the Edge of Arabia gallery in London, and done art exhibits in countries like Sudan, Austria, Egypt, and Italy&#160;&#8212; just to name a few. Next up, Khalid is working on a graphic novel about the history of Sudan, its identity, culture, and traditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of all the censorship [in the Arab world], I still manage to be here, and I think CC is a big part of that. My biggest accomplishment is being where I am today, even with the surroundings that I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite this success, Khalid must continue to work full-time in order to stay in Qatar and works as the Head of Multi-Media in Qatar Museum Authority&#8217;s Public Art and Exhibitions. His cartoons are a side project. &#8220;If anything happens to my residency here, I have to go back to Sudan where I could be dead in a week [&#8230;] Every time I enter Sudan, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s something you come to terms with,&#8221; says Khalid. &#8220;I see it happening every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s this stark reality&#160;&#8212; and love for his region&#160;&#8212; that keeps Khalid in Qatar, even though in another country, perhaps a different region, Khalid could easily pursue cartoons full-time with his stream of offers and commissions. But Khalid isn&#8217;t keen on moving:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to fight in this region. They&#8217;re trying to keep all the power and knowledge to themselves. People should support Creative Commons if they care about what they&#8217;re doing, and they want to get their work to as many people as possible; if they care about collaborating with people all over the world together and coming up with something beautiful&#8230; this is what we&#8217;re supposed to be doing&#160;&#8212; what the internet was made for.&#8220;</p>
