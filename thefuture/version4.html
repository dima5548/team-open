<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4">Version 4.0<a/> was built from the ground up with an international user base in mind, eliminating the need to create custom versions for each jurisdiction. But that would not have been possible if our affiliate network hadn&#8217;t spent the past seven years working to adapt the version 3.0 licenses to the laws of more than 35 countries. All of the lessons we&#8217;ve learned through the porting process are baked into 4.0. The result is a license that just works. Everywhere.</p>

<p>The licenses don&#8217;t just reflect an increasingly global organization and community; they also reflect the new ways in which people have been using CC licenses. The new licenses include provisions related to database rights, personality rights, data mining, and other issues beyond the scope of the original CC licenses. We improved the licenses to catch up with how you&#8217;ve been using them.</p>
