<p>Licenses don&#8217;t change the world. People change the world.</p>

<p>The Creative Commons community is growing every day. We&#8217;re in Finland building a new CC plugin for Wordpress, in Japan hosting an open data symposium, in Kenya hosting School of Open workshops, and in Morocco running booksprints.</p>

<p>The change we believe in in requires more than individual license users. It requires buy-in from governments, institutitons, NGOs, and IGOs, and the CC Affiliate Network is shepherding that change on a worldwide scale.</p>
