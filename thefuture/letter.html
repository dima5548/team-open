<p>Last November, we released Version 4.0 of the Creative Commons licenses. The new licenses represent years of work by dozens of dedicated people&#160;&#8212; some of the foremost intellectual property experts in the world.</p>

<p>Version 4.0 is the most internationally attested set of licenses to date, which wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the expertise and effort of Creative Commons&#8217; affiliate network. It&#8217;s also the most versatile, covering use cases that no one would have thought of 11 years ago. And that wouldn&#8217;t have happened without the diverse community of licensors testing the licenses&#8217; boundaries.</p>

<p>If we didn&#8217;t have those communities, Creative Commons licenses would be an interesting idea and no more. With them, CC is a growing, evolving movement that&#8217;s redefining how knowledge, culture, and information are shared. The affiliates give CC licenses relevance and meaning with their tireless work to build communities around open licensing and open practices.</p>

<p>Something else happened last year; something I believe will have just as deep and long-lasting an impact as the new licenses. We met in Buenos Aires as a staff, board, affiliate network, and community. And in that week of stimulating and lively discussion, one refrain came up again and again: licenses alone will not achieve our dream of greater access to knowledge and culture worldwide. Laws must change too.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, we made it official: Creative Commons now takes a public stance in support of global copyright reform. We urge lawmakers to consider the unintended consequences of overly restrictive copyright law. And we arrived at that stance only because our community led us to it.</p>

<p>In the coming days, I&#8217;ll be stepping down as interim CEO and a new CEO will be coming onboard. And there&#8217;s no doubt they&#8217;ll bring many new changes to the organization. Transitional periods can be confusing, and even frustrating. The future is open, but one thing will never change: our belief that open licensing can transform society and culture for the better.</p>

<p>When those in power choose open licenses, practices, and policies, they align themselves with a future in which individuals are more free to participate in society. This is an exciting moment: governments, corporations, and educational institutions are beginning to recognize that the future is open. Our work is paying off.</p>
