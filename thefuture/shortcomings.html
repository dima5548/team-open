<p>The world has changed a lot in the past year, but there is still more to do for CC, our partners, our community, and you.</p>

<p>While many governments and institutions have gotten onboard with the idea that publicly funded materials should be openly licensed, others make half-steps or non-steps that don&#8217;t bring the world closer to truly open knowledge.<p>

<p>And while the open access movement has made great strides in science, the path to open research in the humanities and social sciences remains less clear.</p>

<p>There are so many areas we hope to explore. We&#8217;re funded by grants from foundations, and donations from people like you. We use every dollar to maximum effect. We want to build tools to help CC licensors to track and measure reuse of their content, but we&#8217;ll need new funds and partners to work with us. We hope you&#8217;ll consider helping with a gift of your time or a donation.</p>
