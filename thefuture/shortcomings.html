<p>The world has changed a lot in the past year, but has it changed enough?</p>

<p>While many governments and institutions have gotten onboard with the idea that publicly funded materials should be openly licensed, others make half-steps or non-steps that don&#8217;t bring the world closer to truly open knowledge.<p>

<p>And while the open access movement has made great strides in science, the path to open research in the humanities and social sciences remains less clear.</p>

<p>Here at CC headquarters, we&#8217;re always eager to accomplish more our limited staff and budget allow. We want to build tools to help CC licensors track and measure reuse of their content, but we haven&#8217;t yet figured out how to fund and sustain those tools.</p>
