<p>The internet makes it easy for people to use and share each other&#8217;s work. But sometimes the law makes it hard. When you share your creative work online, that work is automatically copyrighted with &#8220;all rights reserved&#8221;&#160;&#8212; whether that&#8217;s what you want or not.</p>

<p>But people have been adapting and building upon each other&#8217;s work for centuries. Musicians sample beats from each other&#8217;s music. Artists create collages from other people&#8217;s images. Teachers borrow each other&#8217;s activities and lesson plans. Scientists build off of one another&#8217;s results to make new discoveries. When all of the great content in the world is locked under All Rights Reserved, what&#8217;s left for us to play with? When everyone can use a work, everyone benefits from it.</p>

<p>Creative Commons licenses let you control your copyright: with our free licenses, you can give others permission to use your creations, with &#8220;some rights reserved&#8221; as long as they follow a few simple rules. We believe that everyone should have access to the world&#8217;s knowledge, information, and culture, and we need your help to make it happen.
