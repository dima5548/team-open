<p>There are over half a billion pieces of Creative Commons&#8211;licensed content in the world. That&#8217;s an impressive number, but it only hints at how powerful and widespread CC licenses have become. The real impact is in the stories of how people like you use CC licenses. When you use a CC-licensed photo in a presentation or share your latest song under CC, you&#8217;re a part of the story of CC&#8217;s impact in the world. We&#8217;re proud to share in this amazing journey with you.</p>
