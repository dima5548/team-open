<p>Creative Commons&#8217; vision is &#8220;<a href="//creativecommons.org/about">realizing the full potential of the internet</a>,&#8221; with universal access to culture, knowledge, and education.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a vision that we clearly can&#8217;t achieve on our own. The licenses provide the foundation that enables sharing; the real magic happens when others build tools and services that use those licenses to do amazing things. Over the past year, third-party developers have been making it easier to find and use CC-licensed materials, and big corporations have been starting to share their own work under CC licenses in new ways. It&#8217;s been a big year for the open internet.</p>
