Listen to Kellee Maize’s “[Google Female Rapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhdXG5UM2o),” and you hear her rap about agency, transformation, and community in such rapid precision that it takes you aback. And if you *literally* [Google “female rapper,”](https://www.google.com/search?q=female+rapper&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US503&oq=female+rapper&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.15897j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8)  Kellee is first on the list.

Kellee Maize is a full-time, independent musician out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who raps about spirituality, feminism, and social and political issues. Under a [Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), she shares all of her music freely in the hopes that doing so will raise awareness and help others live a life of positivity and collaboration. 

She first learned of CC after her business partner Joey Rahimi suggested submitting her music through sites like Jamendo and Frostwire, which require a CC license. But the decision wasn’t one Kellee took lightly, and it came with a healthy dose of hesitation.

“When Joey first suggested it, I wasn’t uncomfortable about potentially losing money, but I feared devaluing art. Art is incredibly valuable,” Kellee continues. “It’s a catalyzing medium to evolve consciousness. I realized then that [my music] has more value if I can get it to more people. It was a risk because we could have been wrong. Maybe it wouldn’t pay off. People could get used to having things for free, and not support us… but it worked.”

“Artists have to weigh the options,” Joey adds. “A lot of artists will ask themselves, ‘Am I forgoing $100,000 by offering my music for free?’ And if you have 100,000 downloads, it’s an arguable possibility. The big reason we took the approach was that the more people we can get our music in the hands of, the better we’ll be. With more hands, we can do more things.”

Kellee has over 13,000 videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBhXADStizYpJyXDUZkATg) that use and credit her music - a number that goes up daily. The Creative Commons license on her videos tells people that Kellee wants others to use and remix her music, without having to expressly ask her for permission. As a result, every day, Kellee gains new fans who buy her songs, buy her albums, and attend her shows. With a total of five albums for free under a CC license, her albums have been downloaded *millions* of times.

“CC has definitely been a successful option for us,” says Kellee. “I’ve had over ten million listens of my albums. That is powerful.” It’s allowed Kellee to do music full-time. Through multiple income streams with shows, licensing, mp3 sales, and sponsorships, music is Kellee’s day job. She’s reached #1 on sites like Amazon, Jamendo, Free Music Archive, and Frostwire. On MTV, fellow Pittsburgh rapper [Mac Miller](http://www.mtv.com/news/1678526/mac-miller-pittsburgh-new-artists/) mentioned Kellee as one of the next big MCs coming out of Pittsburgh, and she came in #2 behind Wiz Khalifa as Pittsburgh’s “Top 3 Best Hip-Hop Performers” according to *Pittsburgh City Paper*. Major national media have also featured Kellee, including hip-hop staple *[XXL Magazine](http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2012/03/the-break-presents-kellee-maize/)* and *Huffington Post*. 

This year, Kellee also signed a three-year endorsement deal with Toyota Hybrid as a spokeswoman for its national ad campaigns with [three commercials currently airing](https://www.google.com/search?q=kellee+prius&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS500US500&oq=kellee+prius#q=kellee+maize+prius+commercial&tbm=vid) -- a rare feat for an unsigned, independent artist. “Aside from the content in my music, they chose to work with me because I have millions of downloads,” says Kellee.

This type of support affords Kellee incredible opportunities. In the summer of 2011, she was [voted by fans](http://blog.sonicbids.com/bonnarookelleemaize) to perform at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, joining artists like Eminem and Lil Wayne as one of seven hip-hop acts. The contest is a shining example of her fans’ dedication. By giving freely and generously, her supporters are often more than happy to help her in return.

“I’m very communicative with [our fans] and try to respond to them and create relationships. It’s important to see a real person behind the music. If we ask people to share things, we often see a return and that’s great,” says Kellee. 

Kellee has reached a level of success that many other musicians hope to achieve in their lifetime. In the aim of giving back, Kellee spends a significant portion of her time teaching other musicians [how to make it](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kellee-maize/how-i-made-it-in-the-musi_b_5024003.html#). In doing so, Kellee’s also looking to push against the notions of sharing in the music industry, demonstrating how generosity and a do-it-yourself mentality can benefit artists.

“A lot of artists don’t understand that 95% of artists signed to a label fail,” explains Kellee. “I don’t trust the music industry in general. I don’t think it values music or the artist. When you think about artists like TLC with no money, it’s heartbreaking. There has to be another avenue.”

“CC is one of the many ways we did things differently,” Kellee explains. “I highly recommend it. I was skeptical of it, and I totally see the value now. It’s not for everyone, but it’s also not like you’re signing a record deal where your next three albums are owed to someone. [...] And it doesn’t prevent you from doing traditional things like putting your work on iTunes.”

By doing things differently and testing different strategies, Kellee has been able to bypass competition and create an avenue for herself. She’s maintained her independent status, and most importantly, the power of creative control to write about what matters most to her.

“I’m sharing issues I feel are important - things that I feel inspired by. I share a lot of theories and ideas that have helped me heal personally and believe strongly that you have to be the change you see in the world. Music has been therapy for me to change in many ways.”

In the same way music has shaped Kellee and helped her thrive in the face of challenging life experiences, she hopes freely sharing her music will help her fans feel less alone and ultimately, transform the world into one that is socially and spiritually conscious. It’s an ideal she also views at the heart of hip-hop as a powerful social and political agent of change.

“Hip-hop is and was born out of a need for a voice and for sharing, both as a social advocacy tool, and it just lets you relax, have fun, and forget [what] we’re facing everyday. Hip-hop was free in the beginning, and they’re still free mixtapes every single day from the biggest artists in the world. It’s part of the culture. It makes a lot of sense for hip-hop artists to look into CC -- it holds a foundational interest in sharing ideas, in music, and in power,” says Kellee.

Within hip-hop, Kellee is also eager for her style of conscious rap to become more mainstream. Whereas major labels may not be keen to sign artists in this subgenre, Kellee is optimistic the do-it-yourself tools that allow for sharing and collaboration will help close that chasm -- even if it means challenging the established norms in the industry. 

“Few women are signed to major labels, and mainstream music is not conscious content. So we’re sharing how we’re doing it so other conscious artists, hopefully other women, can learn about it and we can pass along the torch to next generation of conscious art. In hip-hop women are pitted against each other. It’s not about collaboration or unity, and those things are important for music to grow. Opening up to these ideas will be challenging [...] but when we look at fields that are built on sharing like science, things advance, and technology advances, because sharing advances.”

Without sharing, hip-hop, music, and the internet could not be as inspired, innovative, and transformative as it is today and can be tomorrow.
