<p>The future is open.</p>

<p>At its heart, Creative Commons is a simple idea. It’s the idea that when creators build on each other’s work, something amazing happens. And amazing things have been happening.</p>

<p>When CC was founded ten years ago, the law wasn’t keeping up with the potential for creativity on the Internet. But today, the community of CC users is changing the world so quickly that it’s hard for anyone to keep up. Thanks to you, the Internet’s potential is vastly greater today than it was when we started.</p>

<p>In this report, you’ll find out about Creative Commons the organization. You’ll learn where our funding is coming from, what we’re doing with it, and how you can help. But more importantly, you’ll discover how creators, educators, researchers, and governments are using Creative Commons licenses to change their respective corners of the world.</p>

<p>You’ll learn about UNESCO member states’ commitment to making education more accessible to everyone, and find out how new laws in California and British Columbia are making it easier for university students to afford an education. You’ll meet a musician who started selling his music when he started giving it away. You’ll see how scientists are moving from isolation and competition into a culture of sharing and collaboration.</p>

<p>These stories are the lifeblood of Creative Commons. On the surface, this report is about an organization, but it really describes a global network, community, and movement that’s catalyzing massive change. It’s a movement we’re proud to be a part of.</p>
