<p>Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools.</p>

<p>Our free, easy-to-use copyright licenses provide a simple, standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work — on conditions of your choice. CC licenses let you easily change your copyright terms from the default of “all rights reserved” to “some rights reserved.”</p>

<p>Creative Commons licenses are not an alternative to copyright. They work alongside copyright and enable you to modify your copyright terms to best suit your needs.</p>
